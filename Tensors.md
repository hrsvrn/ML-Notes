Tensor is a container for numbers
**0-D tensors/Scalars**  : Tensors with the zero dimension or single element
**1-D tensors/Vectors** : A single array list is a 1D Tensor. 1D Tensor is also called a Vector. 
	Example  [1,2,3,4] is a tensor with dimension 1 and vector dimension 4
	 1D tensors are a collection of Scalars or 0-D tensors
**2-D Tensors/Matrices**: A matrice is called a 2D Tensor.
**ND Tensors** : name implied
**Rank ,Axes  and Shape**
